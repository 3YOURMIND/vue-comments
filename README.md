# vue-comments by [3YOURMIND](https://www.3yourmind.com/)

> A Vue.js plugin to show comments related to an identifier. This identifier is called `projectId` internally but since this component is written with a
> dynamic mindset you can provide your own actions to deal with CRUD operations
> on comments.

## Motivation

This project was created since the 3YOURMIND 3D printing platform needed a
commenting system for the 3D projects. Since the commenting system is used by
two different applications now, the team decided to share the component and open
source it ðŸ¤˜
